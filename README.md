# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification System

A machine learning-based system that classifies movies into genres based on their plot descriptions. The system uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze movie plots and predict their genres.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Genre Classification**: Predicts movie genres based on plot descriptions
- 🎥 **Similar Movies**: Finds similar movies based on plot descriptions
- 🔍 **Feature Importance**: Shows which words are most important for genre classification
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI**: Interactive interface for easy movie genre prediction
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saves trained model for future use
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Provides accuracy scores for model evaluation

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - 📦 pandas
  - 🔢 numpy
  - 🤖 scikit-learn
  - 📚 nltk
  - 📈 matplotlib
  - 🎨 seaborn
  - 🖥️ tkinter
  - ⏳ tqdm
  - 🔄 joblib

## 📁 Project Structure

├── 🎬 movie.py           # Main application code
├── 📚 train_data.txt     # Training dataset
├── 📝 test_data.txt      # Test dataset
└── ✅ test_data_solution.txt  # Test dataset solutions
```

## 🚀 Installation Steps

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download NLTK data (will be done automatically on first run):
   - 📝 punkt
   - 🚫 stopwords
   - 📚 wordnet

## 💻 Execution Steps

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python movie.py
   ```

2. Using the GUI:
   - ✍️ Enter a movie plot description in the text box
   - 🔮 Click "Predict Genre" to get genre predictions
   - 📊 View similar movies and feature importance in the results section

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**:
   - 📥 Loads training and test datasets
   - 🧹 Preprocesses text data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)

2. **Model Training**:
   - 🔢 Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text features
   - 🎯 Trains a Logistic Regression model
   - 💾 Saves the trained model for future use

3. **Prediction Process**:
   - 🧹 Preprocesses input text
   - 🔢 Converts text to numerical features
   - 🔮 Predicts genre using trained model
   - 🎥 Finds similar movies based on plot similarity

4. **Similar Movies**:
   - 📐 Uses cosine similarity to find similar movies
   - 🔍 Combines exact match detection with semantic similarity
   - 📋 Returns top N most similar movies

## 📊 Model Performance

- 🎯 Training Accuracy: ~60-65%
- 📈 Test Accuracy: ~55-60%
- ⚡ Uses optimized parameters for better performance
- 🔄 Implements mini-batch training for efficiency

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

1. **NLTK Data Download Issues**:
   - 🔄 The program will automatically download required NLTK data
   - ❌ If download fails, manually download using:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('punkt')
     nltk.download('stopwords')
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     ```

2. **Model Loading Issues**:
   - 🔄 If model fails to load, it will automatically train a new one
   - 🗑️ Delete `best_model.pkl` to force retraining

3. **Memory Issues**:
   - 🔄 The program uses batch processing to handle large datasets
   - 📉 If you encounter memory errors, try reducing batch size in the code

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🧹 Add more sophisticated text preprocessing
- 🤖 Implement ensemble methods for better accuracy
- 🎯 Add support for multiple genre prediction
- 📊 Include movie metadata in classification
- 🌐 Add web scraping for automatic plot retrieval
